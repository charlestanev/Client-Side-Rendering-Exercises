2.	HTTP Status Cats
We all love cats. They are also a fun way to learn all the HTTP status codes.
Your task is to create a template to represent an HTTP cat card. After you have created the template, render all the cats into the section with id "allCats". Note that there should be a nested <ul> inside the section.
An HTTP cat has an id, statusCode, statusMessage and imageLocation. The cats are seeded using the function from the JS file named "catSeeder.js" â€“ import this file as a module.
Each card block has a button that reveals its status code. You should toggle the button and change its text from "Show status code" to "Hide status code".
See the file example.html for an example of how the rendered HTML should look like.
