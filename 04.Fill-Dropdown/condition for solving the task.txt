Create functionality that loads list items from a remote service and displays them inside a drop-down menu. The user should also be able to add new items to the service by entering them in the input field on the page and submitting the form. Create a template for the drop-down list and the items inside it that can be easily updated with new entries.
When the program starts, the data should be automatically retrieved from the server via GET request from URL http://localhost:3030/jsonstore/advanced/dropdown and rendered as <option> items inside the <select> with id "menu". Upon form submission, send a POST request to the same URL and if it is successful, update the list of options with the newly created item.
Each item has a property text entered by the user and _id, which is generated by the server. When creating the HTML elements, use the _id as option value and text as option textContent.
